## Searching

```bash
# Search for a string inside files
grep -r "search term" ./

# Find files by name
find . -name "*.log"

# Find files modified in the last 24 hours
find . -mtime -1
```

## Permissions

Every file in Linux has an owner and a set of permissions for the owner, group, and others.

```bash
# View permissions
ls -l

# Change permissions (e.g. make a script executable)
chmod +x script.sh

# Change file owner
chown user:group file.txt
```

Permission notation: `rwxr-xr--`
- `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute
- First 3 characters: owner — next 3: group — last 3: others
